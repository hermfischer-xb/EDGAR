"""
EDGAR XBRL Guide (EXG) instance types of a submission: submission sets, entity sets and instance types.

EXG 1.1 defines three kinds of set, and section 3 scopes its rules by them:

- submission sets (Table 6-1): groups of EDGAR submission types, with suffixes (Table 6-2) for submission types
  whose XBRL requirements depend on the form inside the submission (#) or on an exhibit in it (%);
- entity sets (Table 6-3): kinds of registrant;
- instance types (Table 6-4): a submission set, an entity set and for some rows an exhibit type yield an instance
  type code.  "Rows of the table are cumulative; that is, given a submission, every row that matches yields an
  instance type."

The tables are EXG 1.1 "Set Definitions", held as data in validate/resources/exg-set-definitions.json, which
extractSets.py generates from the guide's Word source; nothing here restates them.  Names follow the guide's terms
and Table 6-4's column headings: submissionSet(s), submissionTypes, entitySet(s) (includedEntitySet,
excludedEntitySets), exhibitType, instanceType(s).

EXG's exhibit type (Table 6-4: EX-FILING FEES, EX-98, EX-2.01, EX-99.K SDR, ...) is an EDGAR document type, so it is
matched against the attachmentDocumentType parameter (or dei:DocumentType), not against the exhibitType parameter,
which names the legal exhibit.

Entity sets are a property of the registrant.  Inside EDGAR, where the registration database is available to the
caller of Arelle, they are passed as the parameter entitySets.  Elsewhere they are determined from the submission
itself by the rules in determineEntitySets, which are OUR PROPOSAL (EDGAR-handoffs,
streams/exg-conversion/entity-sets-proposal.md), not EXG text.  When the parameter is given it decides, and the
determined sets are still computed so that a disagreement can be logged.

Instance of a submission vs. the submission: Table 6-4 is cumulative over a submission, but a validation runs on one
instance.  An instance that is itself an exhibit named by a matching row (the fee exhibit, EX-98, EX-2.01, the K and
L SDR exhibits, EX-99.4R HISTORIC, the SBSEF exhibits) takes the instance types of those exhibit rows only; any
other instance takes the matching rows that name no exhibit.  This reading is ours: the guide does not say how an
exhibit's instance is told apart from the primary document's.

This module has no Arelle imports, so that it can be tested on its own.
